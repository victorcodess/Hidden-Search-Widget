# Hidden Search Widget

The search widget provides a customizable search interface for websites. Intially, the input form is hidden in a cirlcle, with only the search icon being revealed. When the user clicks on the search icon, the search widget stretches and reveals the input form.

This is a project form a course by Brad Traversy.

## Lessons Learned

#### CSS
I learn about CSS transitions. I also learnt about positioning of elements on a page. 

#### JavaScript
I learnt about event listeners, which added a class to the icons when the user clicks an icon. 
I also learnt about DOM manipulations using the style selector to change the styling of css classes.
